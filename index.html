      What is an Open Standard
      
      Specifications should be more like software
        - in how they are managed
          - testing (see more below)
        - in how they can be used
          - live examples
        - we are still handling specifications as if they were paper
      
      Testing
        - a specification ought to include tests of its own features. These can then be more easily
          woven into the text (by reference) and managed as the specification evolves.
        - linting can be done
