          As we approach the point at which HTML5 will become a Recommendation, it is time to think
          about how HTML would best be handled next.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing is certain: it won’t be the way in which it has been handled over the past
          couple years. The organisation over the period was targeted almost solely at shipping,
          and therefore largely at cleaning things up on a deadline. But once that stage is reached,
          no such organisation is needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal of this document is to propose a small set of basic principles for the
          organisation of the HTML project after 5.0.

        <h2>Opening HTML</h2>
        <p>
          The idea that Web standards should be open and efforts to make them so have served us
          well. Over time, however, the ways in which people build the Web have evolved. The ways in
          which we cooperate have improved. Much that was experimental in open source projects a
          decade or two ago, and even more that we never foresaw back then, now forms the bedrock of
          Web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          The manner in which we create Web standards today lags behind the Web community’s
          common practices. Web technology is a commons; we need to manage it as such.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is much to do but examples such as the
          <a href='http://responsiveimages.org/'>RICG</a> or the
          <a href='http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/'>DOM</a> show that it is within reach and
          tell us of the pitfalls to avoid.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following principles of openness are to guide the next stages of the HTML
          specification.
        </p>

          <dd>
            A decade or two ago, forking was perceived as a mode of failure. Today, it is a mode of
            collaboration: <em>Make Forks Not War</em>. HTML was granted the right to produce its
            specifications under a Creative Commons license, but that facility has not been put to
            sufficient use so far. It will now be used to apply to all the new work items, since in
            effect they are all extensions to HTML.
          </dd>
          <dt>Royalty-Free</dt>
          <dd>
            The new approach will naturally maintain our ability to ship documents through the W3C
            Process so as to ensure that the Web remains open for all.
          </dd>
          <dt>Hackable</dt>
          <dd>
            A project is only open if it is indeed practicable to participate in it. Having access
            to the code is not enough, it needs to be possible to genuinely process it, through the
            usage of sane convention and open tools that are close enough to common developer
            conventions that they can be picked up easily.

        <h2>Enabling Hackability</h2>
        <p>
          The forkability and royalty-free properties are essentially process issues for which we
          have existing solutions. As such, they are of little direct interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The issue of hackability requires further description though. Beyond the tooling details,
          which are <abbr title="Simple Matter Of Programming">SMOPs</abbr>, a better understanding
          of the goals and approach are useful to have.
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin making HTML a hackable specification will be to split it up into as many pieces
          as required. This is <em>not</em> modularisation as was envisaged previously for XHTML.
          Rather, it is a simple application of the principles at work in software development that
          make code more maintainable — and therefore more open.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to make the split up specification <em>and</em> forks and proposals from the
          community comprehensible, specifications in progress will be made available together
          under <code>drafts.webplatform.org</code>, including a master index of all those
          specifications.
        </p>
        <p>
          To avoid confusion and stay away from the complexities of W3C documents, the templates
          used for the split extension specifications will be visually distinct from those that
          have traditionally been used. (But they will be converted to the regular W3C layout when
          published there.)
        </p>
        <p>
          All of the split specifications will be actively seeking forking and pull requests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specifications are in many ways similar to software products and an important part of
          hackability is to support the same best practices in use there to enable maintainability.
          This includes branching conventions, a distinction between stable features (as
          demonstrated through testing) and development or topic branches where new proposals are
          made.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="next">
        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>
          While the focus on openness for this project may come across as more ideological than
          anything else, it is, at heart, a pragmatic proposal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Making HTML hackable is a logical part of the 
          <a href='http://extensiblewebmanifesto.org/'>Extensible Web Manifesto</a> that we are
          following. The present barriers to developer participation and our systemic inability to
          encourage more editors to join are hurting the platform. Encouraging developers who are
          making use of platform primitives to take the extra step, acquire an understanding of how
          the platform is defined, and contribute would help address existing and upcoming issues,
          most likely in a manner that is easier to implement than higher-level primitives.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, date inputs are still painfully terrible today despite having been proposed
          for the longest time. That is one area (amongst many) for which developer-proposed
          primitives would lead to better results both for authors and implementers. That is
          precisely what we are planning to encourage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting in September:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the first generation of tooling will be made available;</li>
          <li>the first split specifications will be put up;</li>
          <li>documentation to assist the community will progressively be published;</li>
          <li>
            (possibly) <a href='http://discourse.specifiction.org/'>Discourse Specifiction</a> will
            be move to <code>webplatform.org</code> and become part of the project.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In the meantime, we are listening for input and suggestions, and, of course,
          <a href='https://github.com/darobin/after5'>pull requests are welcome</a>!
