          This is work in progress. It has only been looked at by Sam, Paul, PLH, and Robin. This
          document has no official status and was simply produced in response to a request from the
          AB. Some elements of this plan have been rejected previously and could undergo substantial
          changes before coming into effect.

          Between the enactment of “<a
          href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/decision-policy/html5-2014-plan.html">Plan 2014</a>” and the
          release of HTML 5.0 as a Recommendation, the HTML WG was for the most part fully dedicated
          to shipping, knowingly accepting the cost of such a strongly directed effort. Shipping
          HTML 5.0 was considered to be enough of an overwhelming objective that the group’s
          operation over that period can be considered <i>mutatis mutandis</i> as a <em>wartime
          economy</em> in which a singleminded objective primes over flourishing and innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this drive gone, the time has come to reorganise the HTML WG’s operation in the
          manner most conducive to improving the Web. The core ideas behind this reorganisation were
          published in the “<a href="http://darobin.github.io/after5/">After5</a>” plan, much of
          which has already been deployed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Resources available for the production of standards are scarce. Able editors with time to
          dedicate to new work are few and far apart, quality reviewers only have so much
          bandwidth, and test developers are always ridiculously hard to find. In order for us to
          contribute to the furthering of the Web, it therefore behooves us:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            To encourage greater participation — at the very least by not deterring it — and to
            ease the way for new participants to become contributors at all levels. Successful open
            projects have in common a relatively smooth path from minor fixes to expert
            contributions; something at which the Web standards community has been particularly
            inept.
          </li>
          <li>
            To deploy our limited resources in the most productive manner.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          It should be noted that the ruthless efficiency applied to a single-minded time-driven
          release schedule entails an organisation of labour very different from the ruthless
          efficiency seeking the blossoming of innovation. The change is from a regimen of decrees
          and officialdom to one of experimentation and reciprocal obligations.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is this philosophy and these constraints which together helm the whole of this plan. In
          fact, in more ways than one this is a plan against planification. It is grounded in the
          belief that the primary and perhaps sole function of “leadership” in the HTML project is
          to trust in the community’s intelligence and competence by providing support,
          infrastructure, and assistance for its work. Such a community can only be directed,
          planned, or scheduled with circumspection and Montesquieu’s trembling hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before diving into further details, it should be noted that such an approach has direct
          implications that are worth highlighting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps most notably, considering that duplication of work is a net loss to progressing
          the Web as are manual integration costs (e.g. from cherry-picking individual changes),
          this plan explicitly delegates the initial triage of some core parts of the Web platform to
          the WHATWG. While this may strike some as a radical change it is in truth nothing but the
          ratification of an existing reality. The primary benefit over denialism on this topic is
          the freeing of resources that it enables.
        </p>
        <p>
          It must be noted however that this acquiescence to reality comes not without its pitfalls.
          Several attempts at finding a modus vivendi with the WHATWG have run aground on issues
          of IPR and escalation of decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          IPR problems are well-known and apply across the board to the documents produced by the
          WHATWG. There is little that can be done but keep the door open for a potential future
          agreement on IPR-friendly stable snapshots.
        </p>
        <p>
          The question of escalation is more subtle. 
          While the overwhelming majority of bugs processed in the development of
          the WHATWG HTML Living Standard are resolved in ways that meet the W3C
          definition of 
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/2014/Process-20140801/#Consensus">consensus</a>,
          WHATWG HTML does however suffer from
          “<a href="http://berjon.com/is-html-too-big-to-fail/">too big to fail</a>” externalities
          that decrease the editor’s responsibility for his actions and thereby negatively affect
          the specification’s evolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          These issues must be accounted for in our plan. We must operate such that these additional
          desirable properties are externally bolted onto the WHATWG where needed, while keeping the
          cost of this forcible integration low and leaving the door open to future friendlier
          cooperation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some may be tempted to castigate this approach as “pro-WHATWG” (whatever that means) or
          that it carries an existential threat to W3C. Neither of these straw-people strikes us as
          carrying value. To the first one we shall simply point out that there are no sides but the
          Web. To the second we can only note that if the W3C’s advantage sits solely in its IPR and
          consensus policies but the WHATWG is superior in all other important aspects then the only
          existential threat to W3C would be W3C itself. It is the W3C’s sole responsibility to
          excel at standardisation, independently from what other organisations do.
        </p>
        <p>
          To excel is not out of reach, or perhaps even so far as it may sometimes appear.
          Altogether too often W3C working groups have constrained their thinking about how to
          operate to a set of behaviours <em>perceived</em> to represent the requirements placed
          upon them by the W3C Process. Much of the time, these constraints are imaginary. While
          there is no denying that the production of royalty-free technology and a strong preference
          for broad consensus do place some demands on a group’s operation, there are many ways in
          which a group can carry out its day-to-day work without such requirements getting in the
          way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that while this document specifically targets the HTML WG, it can also read as a
          broad set of suggestions for reform in the manner in which groups in general operate, most
          specifically large groups with broad remits.
        </p>
      </div>

      <section id="org">
        <h2>Organisation &amp; Work Mode</h2>
        <p>
          Over the past two years, the core HTML WG has been productive almost exclusively at
          shipping HTML5. The parts of the group that have produced novel, useful <a
          href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/decision-policy/html5-2014-plan.html#extension-specs">extension
          specifications</a> are some of its task forces such as for example the Media TF
          or the Editing TF.
        </p>
        <p>
          Certainly the adamantine focus on shipping that dominated the core group is part of this,
          but not alone. There are several issues with working as part of a broad group:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Would-be participants report it as daunting;</li>
          <li>The platform is broad while interests are often more specific;</li>
          <li>It encourages drive-by comments;</li>
          <li>It discourages participation from those who do not wish to handle a fire-hose;</li>
          <li>
            What dysfunctional behaviour may exist in the group tends to be suffered by all while
            the parts that operate well mostly benefit (directly) those who care about them;
          </li>
          <li>
            Coupled with a large document that carries a deep gravitational well it discourages
            contributions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A single group is not without its advantages (notably built-in coordination) but in
          practice they are outweighed by the downsides. It is notable that groups that operate as
          one large entity have resorted to filtering mechanisms, and in effect many participants
          are known to tune out the parts they do not directly care about.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, we recommend the following organisation for the group: focused topic areas,
          some of which are currently handled as separate Task Forces, are to be handled in their
          own Community Groups (replacing the existing Task Forces). The list of CGs need not be
          fixed, on the contrary it is expected to evolve over time. <a href="#cgs">Examples of
          possible CGs</a> are given below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Naturally, this does not instate a mandate to produce any kind of work. Participation
          commitments in W3C working groups are made under the agreement that the group’s
          intellectual property scope be sufficiently clearly bounded. One does not simply add a
          deliverable to a working group if it is not in scope. We can however expect the upcoming
          HTML WG’s charter to define its IP boundaries in a manner similar to the current one.
          While not open-ended, these boundaries are broad enough to accommodate new work that
          cannot necessarily be fully predicted two years in advance. This flexibility is to our
          advantage since it affords us the ability to reach intelligent judgement calls through
          concrete discussions (on public-html-admin) as to whether a proposed new work item fits
          within the established boundaries rather than constraining us to operate within the
          limitation of prescriptive foresight that, with two years to look ahead to, none of us
          has.
        </p>
        <p>
          CGs can organise as they wish to subject to the <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/community/about/#cg ">W3C Community Group process</a>. They can
          involve broad participation. Their process can be radically lightweight, while still
          operating within the boundaries of the W3C Community Group IPR policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          CGs can notably publish forkable specifications (see notes below on <a
          href="#licensing">licensing</a>) so as to encourage participation by avoiding
          contribution-hostile constraints [<strong>NOTE</strong>: the ability for CGs to use such
          licenses needs to be validated by W3C legal]. They need not rely on communication methods
          that are often disliked by today’s Web developers and can easily make use of more modern
          alternatives (more on this in the <a href="#tooling">tooling section</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Under this regime the core HTML WG would have as one of its functions to serve as a
          coordination forum between CGs, helping to sort out problems that may need cooperation
          amongst them or with the core HTML specification (<a href="#draft">publication details for
          which</a> are outlined below). It can also serve as a catch-all group for work that does
          not yet have a home of its own. At heart, this coordination is meant to enable the
          involvement of a broader community when it is needed. This may happen when a CG does not
          feel comfortable that it has the necessary knowledge or context to make progress on a
          topic, or when dissent amongst groups or inside of one would be helped by a discussion of
          the whole village. To extend the metaphor, it should be noted that if one is to call upon
          a gathering of the whole village for every minor issue and squabble, the villagers might
          not consider one favourably for long.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such coordination is meant to be called upon solely as needed, and not enforced through a
          constant flow of artificial and seldom read activity reports as has been the case in the
          past in what used to be known as “Coordination Groups”.
        </p>
        <p id="td">
          Technical disputes are encouraged to be addressed through forking and merging (since CGs
          can avail themselves of forkable licenses), the goal being for dissent to operate on
          camera-ready documents. Only once a pull request has been thoroughly discussed with still
          no resolution in sight should a broader assembly be convened. Once it has, the usual
          machinery of group decisions apply. Disputes that are not grounded in a concrete proposal,
          implemented through a pull request or similar mechanism, expose themselves to summary
          dismissal. Perhaps counterintuitively given the naming, the primary goal of a forkable
          license is a merging process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the past two years, the HTML WG has worked in tandem with CGs, notably the <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/">Responsive Images Community Group</a>. One of
          the primary complaints has been the overhead imposed on such groups to report on their
          status and produce heartbeats. To address that, CGs that produce <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/final/">Final Specifications</a> can
          bring them to the HTML WG as a way to get them to Recommendation relatively efficiently,
          provided they have undergone credible levels of review, which naturally includes a
          reasonable amount of testing. As experience is gathered with this division of labour, the
          HTML WG could set up procedures allowing for the automatic publication of CG Final
          Specifications as Candidate Recommendations (which can be a First Public Working Draft at
          the same time).
        </p>
        <p>
          When a Final Specification is accepted for publication by the HTML WG, if its content is
          intended to replace a given part of the HTML specification, the part in question is then
          removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Community Groups have a broad mandate to organise themselves in whatever creative manner
          they see fit, provided that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>They document where one can follow and participate the work;</li>
          <li>
            They, in practice, adhere to a form of consensus decision-making. Note that this can
            vary very much from one instantiation to another.
          </li>
          <li>
            They keep as good a paper trail as possible of contributions from participants. A good
            example of such a paper trail would be commit logs or pull-requests.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Spreading the work in several locations does have the downside that it can make finding
          the proper place in which to participate harder. This will be addressed by making the
          HTML WG’s home page essentially be a participation map, very clear and above the fold,
          that points to every group with details about the topics covered there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, in order to facilitate the work of people who wish to provide feedback, each
          group will document how it prefers to receive feedback and what its high-level policies
          (e.g. commit-then-review or the reverse). The goal here is notably to simplify the lives
          of horizontal groups that have to deal with many different organisations that can be hard
          to guess.
        </p>
        <p>
          CGs will naturally require some guidance in order to produce good specifications. With
          this in mind it would be helpful to produce a resource pointing to the various existing
          (but scattered or unfinished) resources about writing good specifications, and to point
          out specific details about what make good extension specifications.
        </p>
        <p>
          The expectation is that the HTML WG would operate under the <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/2014/Process-20140801/">2014 Process </a> (without which the
          useful mouthful that is the “First Public Working Draft Candidate Recommendation” is not
          possible).
        </p>
        <p>
          The current (more recent) <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/wg/WorkMode">work mode</a>
          of the HTML group is derived from that of the WebApps WG. Usage of regular telcons should
          be revisited by the group, while of course ad hoc ones can be scheduled (and CGs are
          allowed to make use of them is they so desire). If expressly requested by direct
          stakeholders, a coordination call between CGs may be held, for instance on a monthly
          basis. Occasional face to face meetings are to be expected, but may not involve the entire
          group.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Note</strong>: in the past some provisions of the Invited Expert agreement have
          forced individuals to choose between participating in a given W3C activity and a similar
          activity elsewhere, to the detriment of participation. By the time the charter for this
          new group is approved, the <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/01-invited-expert.html">2015/01 version of
          the Invited Expert and Collaborator Agreement</a> is expected to be in effect, which will
          address this problem.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section id="tooling">
        <h2>Open Tooling</h2>
        <p>
          Both the HTML WG and its related CGs can make use of whatever tools they see fit for
          a given specification, but we call out a number of options here as they are expected to
          take up a central place in these operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          For drafts under the control of the HTML WG (since this is not an option we can offer CGs
          yet) the new “<a href="https://github.com/w3c/echidna">Echidna</a>” automated publishing
          system that is to be deployed on <code>labs.w3.org</code> in early February 2015 is
          strongly encouraged. This tool essentially allows a group to use <a
          href="http://w3.org/TR/">http://w3.org/TR/</a> for its Editor’s Drafts. Editors can set
          their draft up such that any commit triggers a new publication there. This is designed to
          avoid specifications in TR space from going stale. As many Working Drafts as are needed
          can be published, every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Groups that so desire are encouraged to make use of GitHub, not just for repositories but
          also for discussion if that is their preference. A tool that makes it possible to backup
          not just the <code>git</code> part but also the issues, comments, etc. is expected to be
          made available. This should address concerns over migration should the need arise.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="http://discourse.specifiction.org/">Discourse</a> is already available for
          broad discussions with the community. Groups are encouraged to request new categories that
          match their needs better than those already in existence (as was done by the
          <a href="http://discourse.specifiction.org/c/asm-js">asm.js</a> folks). The current
          administrators are happy to mint moderators and support the mode of operation required
          by groups wishing to work there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, the <a href="https://specs.webplatform.org/docs/">WebSpecs</a> project is open to
          every project that wishes to use it as a publishing platform at which to maintain its
          documents. The project is specifically designed to publish from GitHub repositories with
          very minimal overhead (once you have a specification ready, integrating the project is
          pretty much one pull request away) while avoiding the scattered nature and complexity of
          dozens of GitHub repositories that can be hard to find. It also operates on the core
          assumption that multiple forked version of the same specification can be maintained at the
          same time in order to facilitate discussion (and, eventually, merges).
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section id="draft">
        <h2>Core HTML Draft Publication</h2>
        <p>
          While the CGs may publish as they please, the HTML WG at present retains the
          responsibility of publishing the HTML specification itself. The publication is expected to
          operate under the following requirements:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Be frequent;</li>
          <li>Minimise additive differences with the WHATWG version (but have extensive leeway to subset it);</li>
          <li>Aspire to be as close to reality, as supported by testing, as possible;</li>
          <li>Avoid the overhead of errata as much as possible, ideally completely;</li>
          <li>Be automated in every manner possible.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Note that “additive” describes features defined as part of the HTML WG or one of its
          related Community Groups. New features defined in the WHATWG, if acceptable and deemed to
          match reality, will simply be included.
        </p>
        <p>
          Frequent publication is expected to be achieved through two-fold automation. First, the
          draft is maintained as a set of transformations to the WHATWG’s version using a tool
          called “<a href="https://github.com/darobin/spork">Spork</a>”. These transformations are
          specified, as code, by the editors in charge of the HTML draft at W3C (the list of whom
          still needs to be established). This avoids synchronisation issues that have made work
          slow and painful in the past and serves to maintain the <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/html/landscape/">Landscape Document</a> as direct documentation of
          Spork’s operations. The ideal goal is to reach a point at which the W3C HTML specification
          is just a subset of WHATWG HTML with two types of excisions: parts that do not match
          reality, and parts that are being developed in separate documents. Second, the output from
          these transformations is to be fed into the new Echidna automated publishing system and
          published under <code>/TR/html</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It should be noted that while a strict subset is the desirable option, there are cases in
          which it is not entirely possible. To take an example from HTML 5.0, while in an ideal
          situation the ruby section of the HTML 5.0 specification could have been dropped and
          replaced with a separate extension specification, the interactions of that feature with
          the HTML parsing algorithm did not make that a viable option. Keeping such cases to a
          minimum is, however, an express goal. When needed, they are to be handled in the manner
          described in the paragraph on <a href="#td">technical disputes</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The astute reader may note at this point that this organisation takes steps towards
          establishing the WHATWG as one CG (which it already is) that publishes through its
          coordination with the HTML WG, with modifications made to account for the atypical nature
          of the document. There are several ways in which such a setup would be desirable, and the
          organisation is deliberate. However it should be noted that it is not at this point a
          political reality, that making it so would require a number of issues between the two
          groups to be addressed, and that no claim is made here about endorsement from the WHATWG
          for this plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the drive to get HTML 5.0 to Recommendation, the process employed was one of manual
          cherry-picking of individual WHATWG changes. Editors would both apply their own changes
          and integrate upstream changes from WHATWG HTML. One purported benefit of this approach
          was that HTML WG members were given explicit batch notifications of changes and had the
          opportunity to disagree with the acceptance or rejection of upstream changes. In practice,
          this opportunity was seldom used and the cherry-picking process was essentially a very
          costly way of accepting WHATWG changes. This proposal removes the cost while still making
          it possible for participants to maintain the ability to review accepted or rejected
          changes simply by tracking the commit logs from the upstream WHATWG HTML and Spork
          repositories. We would be willing to entertain discussions of alternatives, but only if
          such proposals include details describing how the both financial and technical aspects
          will be addressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The DOM specification is expected to follow a similar treatment, modulo the fact that
          strict subsetting (corresponding exclusively to test-failing) is far more likely. Having
          said that, some interoperability issues with the DOM that cannot be subsetted away are
          currently pending implementer input, and without such input the specification may,
          according to the principles expressed herein, find itself on indefinite hold.
        </p>
        <p>
          The expectation is that the HTML specification will go to Recommendation every year,
          based on the features it contains that have tests and pass them sufficiently well. Rules
          concerning which tests ought to pass or not tend to have nasty side-effects (e.g. removing
          tests to ensure that the document passes and other such weaselling). Instead, the
          recommended practice is to make use of judgement calls when assessing interoperability,
          the key components of which being rough usability by developers and improvements compared
          to the previous year’s situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even with the improvements to the errata process that the AB is considering which includes
          a number of simplifications, one has to question whether it is useful to maintain errata
          against HTML. Errata are valuable in the case in which no new features are being added to
          a specification, and patent commitments that were made for an existing Recommendation may
          no longer be made for the revised one.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML is not in such a situation. HTML is seeing new features, and we are not seeing major
          shifts in participation that impact patent commitments. The expectation is that publishing
          a Recommendation every year is sufficient to obviate the need for errata on previous
          Recommendations. Where required, these could be exposed as a diff of the documents as is
          likely to become possible with Process 2015 should the AB enact its modifications to the
          handling of errata (note however that such a diff would likely be large and hard to
          review).

        <h2>Bug Handling</h2>
        <p>
          Over the past few years HTML-related bugs have been filed in both the WHATWG and the HTML
          WG. This duplication is at best a waste of effort and at worst induces confusion on its
          own.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the future, when finding a bug in the core HTML specification, reviewers are expected
          to file it against
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/enter_bug.cgi?product=WHATWG&amp;component=HTML">the 
          HTML component of the WHATWG product</a> in W3C’s Bugzilla and solely there. This proposal
          may not be consensual, but experience with handling the duplication has proven unpleasant
          (and wasteful). Alternatives suggestions are welcome; but the goal is just to be simple
          and efficient since there’s enough work for everyone and then some.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the resolution of a given bug is not satisfactory (either to the reporting individual
          or to a third-party), it should be duplicated to the W3C Bugzilla HTML product for further
          discussion in the HTML WG, or to the corresponding CG bug tracker if applicable.
        </p>
        <p>
          For new features, the default mode of operation is for them to be defined in a separate
          document. They should therefore be directed to a CG if one exists that matches in scope,
          or failing that to <a href="http://discourse.specifiction.org/">Discourse</a> where the
          community can help orient the proposal to its proper home, setting it up if needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          A large bug backlog has accumulated while the HTML WG focused on shipping HTML 5.0. These
          bugs need to be ventilated and triaged amongst those that have been overtaken by events,
          those that have been fixed, those that aren’t relevant to the HTML 5.0 or HTML 5.1
          document and those that, shockingly enough, need to be fixed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Triaging the latter will require knowing where they need to be sent. This depends largely
          on the setup described herein coming into effect. It should be noted that some CGs may
          prefer bug tracking systems other than Bugzilla. In such cases the bugs will be moved there
          and the original tracker appraised accordingly.

        <h2>Licensing</h2>
        <p>
          It is the de facto expectation of would-be contributors today that a project calling
          itself “open”, be it source, science, data, or standards, would operate under a
          contributor-friendly license in which rights granted for usage and modification are
          reciprocal. When developers learn that the W3C does not publish under such an agreement,
          they are baffled and at a loss for words. It simply does not fit into the W3C’s image as a
          place defending openness, and it certainly deprives the W3C’s standards from being
          considered open, let alone for W3C to take a credible open stand for anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          In view of our goals for increased participation, and considering that all standards
          should be open, this plan’s recommendation is for the production of all CGs related to the
          HTML WG to be licensed under the W3C Software License. This license not only can be
          applied to specifications, but it also affords the guarantees desired from CC-BY while
          remaining GPL-compatible. It is also the default copyright license in the <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/2009/12/Member-Agreement">W3C Member Agreement (last 2 sentences
          of 7b)</a> which states that “copyrightable materials (…) will be made available to the
          general public pursuant to the then-current W3C Software Notice and License.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Adopting the W3C Software License for the HTML specification itself is also highly
          desirable, but would require the agreement of the AC. CGs however can freely adopt the
          license they desire and we suggest that they should use the W3C Software License unless
          overwhelming reasons not to are put forth.

        <h2>Example CGs</h2>
        <p>
          The set of CGs related to the HTML WG is meant to be dynamic and evolve over time in a
          flexible manner, the sole constraint being the chartered boundaries of the HTML WG. The
          following are however a few examples that could provide a good starting point based on
          existing experience.

          <dd>
            The existing joint HTML-WebApps TF is already well under way but it is hitting up a few
            Invited Expert issues and could live with being a CG rather than the always clunky joint
            Task Force.
          </dd>
          <dt>Media APIs
          <dd>
            New Media APIs are needed, and some coherence could usefully be brought amongst all the
            people extending HTMLMediaElement. Some recent ideas about media controls could also
            fit here. Note that there is an existing HTML WG Media TF. Whether it should be extended
            to include new deliverables or whether two groups with different media aspects ought to
            be considered is left as a decision of the interested parties.
          </dd>
          <dt>Accessibility
          <dd>
            Much useful work is still needed in order for the Web platform to be accessible. While
            accessibility-review of other groups’ work is best conducted directly in those groups,
            this CG should define the technologies that are directly accessibility-centric. There
            has been some degree of dissent concerning some of the outputs from this task force; it
            is currently working on defining its upcoming work items.
          </dd>
          <dt>Canvas
          <dd>
            The 2DContext is an area of continued interest and given its specific, focused work
            could constitute a useful CG on its own.
          </dd>
          <dt>Markup for Application UIs
          <dd>
            There may be a set of elements that could usefully be added to HTML for
            (semantic) application components. Some work has already kicked off (in a deliberately
            discreet corner) about this and there is interest from some browser vendors. Also: form
            controls are still a problem.

          <dd>
            In February. The new Echidna system is expected to support the publication. The goal is
            for a Recommendation by year end 2015.

          <dt>The mode of operation outlined in this document</dt>
          <dd>
            Assuming the HTML WG can agree to it, it is expected to be deployed during the coming
            HTML WG face to face meeting in April 2015.
          </dd>
          <dt>Rechartering of the group</dt>
          <dd>
            Much of the HTML WG rechartering depends on agreement about this plan. Assuming the
            April milestone is hit for that, a new charter can be proposed to the W3C Membership
            shortly thereafter.
          </dd>
          <dt>New CR for the DOM</dt>
          <dd>
            As explained above, our requirements to focus on interoperability are blocking the DOM
            specification’s progression along Recommendation-track until at least 
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=22960">bug 22960</a> and
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=19431">bug 19431</a> are
            addressed through implementer decisions. Given the current lack of interoperability any
            alternative blesses an option with insufficient real-world support.
