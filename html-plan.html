        <p>
          Between the enactment of “Plan 2014” and the release of HTML 5.0 as a Recommendation, the
          HTML WG was for the most part fully dedicated to shipping, knowingly accepting the cost
          of such a strongly directed effort. Shipping HTML 5.0 was considered to be enough of an
          overwhelming objective that the group’s operation over that period can be considered
          <i>mutatis mutandis</i> as a <em>wartime economy</em> in which a singleminded objective
          primes over flourishing and innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this drive gone, the time has come to reorganise the group’s operation in the manner
          most conducive to improving the Web. The core ideas behind this reorganisation were
          published in the “<a href="http://darobin.github.io/after5/">After5</a>” plan, much of
          which has already been deployed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Resources available for the production of standards are scarce. Able editors with time to
          dedicate to new work are few and far apart, quality reviewers only have so much
          bandwidth, test developers are always ridiculously understaffed. In order for us to
          contribute to the furthering of the Web, it therefore behooves us:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            To encourage greater participation — at the very least by not deterring it — and to
            ease the way for new participants to become contributors at all levels. Successful open
            projects have in common a relatively smooth path from minor fixes to expert
            contributions; something at which the Web standards community has been particularly
            inept.
          </li>
          <li>
            To deploy our limited resources in the most productive manner.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          It should be noted that the ruthless efficiency applied to a single-minded time-driven
          release schedule entails an organisation of labour very different from the ruthless
          efficiency seeking the blossoming of innovation. The change is from a regimen of decrees
          and officialdom to one of experimentation and reciprocal obligations.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is this philosophy and these constraints which together helm the whole of this plan. In
          fact, in more ways than one this is a plan against planification. It is grounded in the
          belief that the primary and perhaps sole function of “leadership” in the HTML project is
          to trust in the community’s intelligence and competence by providing support,
          infrastructure, and assistance for its work. Such a community can only be directed,
          planned, or scheduled with circumspection and Montesquieu’s trembling hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before diving into further details, it should be noted that such an approach has direct
          implications that are worth highlighting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps most notably, considering that duplication of work is a net loss to progressing
          the Web as are manual integration costs (e.g. from cherry-picking), this plan explicitly
          delegates the management of some core parts of the Web platform to the WHATWG. While this
          may strike some as a radical change it is in truth nothing but the ratification of an
          existing reality. The primary benefit over denialism on this topic is the freeing of
          resources that it enables.
        </p>
        <p>
          It must be noted however that this acquiescence to reality comes not without its pitfalls.
          Several attempts at finding a modus vivendi with the WHATWG have run aground on issues
          of IPR and escalation of consensus decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          IPR problems are well-known and apply across the board to the documents produced by the
          WHATWG. There is little that can be done but keep the door open for a potential future
          agreement on IPR-friendly snapshots.
        </p>
        <p>
          The question of escalation is more subtle. Most WHATWG specifications effectively operate
          under consensus and escalation policies that are in effect no worse than those afforded by
          the best W3C working groups. WHATWG HTML does however suffer from
          “<a href="http://berjon.com/is-html-too-big-to-fail/">too big to fail</a>” externalities
          that decrease the editor’s responsibility for his actions and thereby negatively affect
          the standard’s evolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          These issues must be accounted for in our organisation. We must operate such that these
          desirable properties are externally bolted onto the WHATWG where needed, while keeping the
          cost of this forcible integration low and leaving the door open to future friendlier
          cooperation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some may be tempted to castigate this approach as “pro-WHATWG” (whatever that means) or
          that it carries an existential threat to W3C. Neither of these strawpeople strike me as
          carrying value. To the first one I shall simply point out that there are no sides but the
          Web. To the second I can only note that if the W3C’s advantage sits solely in its IPR and
          consensus policies but the WHATWG is superior in all other important aspects then the only
          existential threat to W3C would be W3C itself. It is the W3C’s sole responsibility to
          excel at standardisation, independently from what other organisations do.
        </p>
        <p>
          To excel is not out of reach, or perhaps even so far as it may sometimes appear.
          Altogether too often W3C working groups have constrained their thinking about how to
          operate to a set of behaviours <em>perceived</em> to represent the requirements placed
          upon them by the W3C Process. Much of the time, these constraints are imaginary. While
          there is no denying that the production of royalty-free technology and a strong preference
          for broad consensus do place some demands on a group’s operation, there are many ways in
          which a group can carry out its day-to-day work without such requirements getting in the
          way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that while this document specifically targets the HTML WG, it can also read as a
          broad set of suggestions for reform in the manner in which groups in general operate, most
          specifically large groups with broad remits.
        </p>
      </div>

      <section id="org">
        <h2>Organisation &amp; Work Mode</h2>
        <p>
          Over the past two years, the core HTML WG has been productive almost exclusively at
          shipping HTML5. The parts of the group that have produced novel, useful work are some of
          its satellite task forces such as the Media TF or the Editing TF.
        </p>
        <p>
          Certainly the adamantine focus on shipping that dominated the core group is part of this,
          but not alone. There are several issues with working as part of a broad group:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Would-be participants report it as daunting;</li>
          <li>The platform is broad while interests are often more specific;</li>
          <li>It encourages drive-by comments;</li>
          <li>It discourages participation from those who do not wish to handle a fire-hose;</li>
          <li>
            What dysfunctional behaviour may exist in the group tends to be suffered by all while
            the parts that operate well mostly benefit (directly) those who care about them;
          </li>
          <li>
            Coupled with a large document that carries a deep gravitational well it discourages
            contributions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A single group is not without its advantages (notably built-in coordination) but in
          practice they are outweighed by the downsides. It is notable that groups that operate as
          one large entity have resorted to filtering mechanisms, and in effect many participants
          are known to tune out the parts they do not directly care about.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, we recommend the following organisation for the group: focused topic areas,
          some of which are currently handled as separate Task Forces, are to be handled in their
          own Community Groups. The list of CGs need not be fixed, on the contrary it is expected
          to evolve over time. <a href="#cgs">Examples of possible CGs</a> are given below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Naturally, this does not instate a mandate to produce any kind of work. Participation
          commitments in groups are made under the agreement that the group’s intellectual property
          scope be sufficiently clearly bounded. One does not simply add a deliverable to a working
          group if it is not in scope. We can however expect the upcoming HTML WG’s charter to
          define its IP boundaries in a manner similar to the current one. While not open-ended,
          these boundaries are broad enough to accommodate new work that cannot necessarily be
          fully predicted two years in advance. This flexibility is to our advantage since it
          affords us the ability to reach intelligent judgement calls through concrete discussions
          (on public-html-admin) as to whether a proposed new work item fits within the established
          boundaries rather than constraining us to operate within the limitation of prescriptive
          foresight that, with two years to look ahead to, none of us has.
        </p>
        <p>
          CGs can organise as they wish to. They can involve broad participation. Their process can
          be radically lightweight, while still operating within the boundaries of an IPR policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          CGs can notably publish forkable specification (see notes below on 
          <a href="#licensing">licensing</a>) so as to encourage participation by avoiding
          contribution-hostile constraints. They need not rely on communication methods that are
          often disliked by today’s Web developers and can easily make use of more modern
          alternatives (more on this in the <a href="#tooling">tooling section</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Under this regime the core HTML WG would have as one of its functions to serve as a
          coordination forum between CGs, helping to sort out problems that may need cooperation
          amongst them or with the core HTML specification (<a href="#draft">publication details for
          which</a> are outlined below). It can also serve as a catch-all group for work that does
          not yet have a home of its own. At heart, this coordination is meant to enable the
          involvement of a broader community when it is needed. This may happen when a CG does not
          feel comfortable that it has the necessary knowledge or context to make progress on a
          topic, or when dissent amongst groups or inside of one would be helped by a discussion of
          the whole village. To extend the metaphor, it should be noted that if one is to call upon
          a gathering of the whole village for every minor issue and squabble, the villagers might
          not consider one favourably for long.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such coordination is meant to be called upon solely as needed, and not enforced through a
          constant flow of artificial and seldom read activity reports as has been the case in the
          past in what used to be known as “Coordination Groups”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technical disputes are encouraged to be addressed through forking and merging (since CGs
          can avail themselves of forkable licenses), the goal being for dissent to operate on
          camera-ready documents. Only once a pull request has been thoroughly discussed with still
          no resolution in sight should a broader assembly be convened. Once it has, the usual
          machinery of group decisions apply. Disputes that are not grounded in a concrete proposal,
          implemented through a pull request or similar mechanism, expose themselves to summary
          dismissal. Perhaps counterintuitively given the naming, the primary goal of a forkable
          license is a merging process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the past two years, the HTML WG has worked in tandem with CGs, notably the RICG. One
          of the primary complaints has been the overhead imposed on such groups to report on their
          status and produce heartbeats. To address that, CGs that produce Final Specifications can
          bring them to the HTML WG as a way to get them to Recommendation relatively efficiently.
          As experience is gathered with this division of labour, the HTML WG could set up
          procedures allowing for the automatic publication of CG Final Specifications as Candidate
          Recommendations (which can be a FPWD at the same time).
        </p>
        <p>
          Community Groups have a broad mandate to organise themselves in whatever creative manner
          they see fit, provided that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>They document where one can follow and participate the work;</li>
          <li>
            They, in practice, adhere to a form of consensus decision-making. Note that this can
            vary very much from one instantiation to another.
          </li>
          <li>
            They keep as good a paper trail as possible of contributions from participants. A good
            example of such a paper trail would be commit logs or pull-requests.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The expectation is that the core group would operate under the 2014 Process (without which
          the useful mouthful that is the “First Public Working Draft Candidate Recommendation” is
          not possible).
        </p>
        <p>
          The current (more recent) work mode of the core HTML group is derived from that of WebApps
          and that will continue to be the case. Usage of regular telcons should be revisited by the
          group, while of course ad hoc ones can be scheduled (and CGs are allowed to make use of
          them is they so desire). If expressly requested by direct stakeholders, a coordination
          call between CGs may be held, for instance on a monthly basis. Occasional face to face
          meetings are to be expected, but may not involve the entire group (except at least once a
          year).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Note</strong>: in the past some provisions of the Invited Expert agreement have
          forced individuals to choose between participating in a given W3C activity and a similar
          activity elsewhere, to the detriment of participation. By the time the charter for this
          new group is approved, the <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/01-invited-expert.html">2015/01 version of
          the Invited Expert and Collaborator Agreement</a> is expected to be in effect.

      <section id="tooling">
        <h2>Open Tooling</h2>
        <p>
          Both the main group and its satellite CGs can make use of whatever tools they see fit for
          a given specification, but we call out a number of options here as they are expected to
          take up a central place in these operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          For drafts under the control of an core WG (since this is not an option we can offer CGs
          yet) the new “<a href="https://github.com/w3c/echidna">Echidna</a>” automated publishing
          system that is to be deployed on <code>labs.w3.org</code> in early February is strongly
          encouraged. This tool essentially allows a group to use <a
          href="http://w3.org/TR/">http://w3.org/TR/</a> for its Editor’s Drafts. Editors can set
          their draft up such that any commit triggers a new publication there. This is designed to
          avoid TR space from going stale. As many WDs as are needed can be published, every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Groups that so desire are welcome to make use of GitHub, not just for repositories but
          also for discussion if that is their preference. A tool that makes it possible to backup
          not just the <code>git</code> part but also the issues, comments, etc. is expected to be
          made available when time allows it. This should address concerns over migration should the
          need arise.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="http://discourse.specifiction.org/">Discourse</a> is already available for
          broad discussions with the community. Groups are welcome to request new categories that
          match their needs better than those already in existence (as was done by the
          <a href="http://discourse.specifiction.org/c/asm-js">asm.js</a> folks). The current
          administrators are happy to mint moderators and support the mode of operation required
          by groups wishing to work there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, the <a href="https://specs.webplatform.org/docs/">WebSpecs</a> project is open to
          every and all project that wishes to use it as a publishing platform at which to maintain
          its documents. The project is specifically designed to publish from GitHub repositories
          with very minimal overhead (once you have a specification ready, integrating the project
          is pretty much one pull request away) while avoiding the scattered nature and complexity
          of dozens of GitHub repositories that can be hard to find. It also operates on the core
          assumption that multiple forked version of the same specification can be maintained at the
          same time in order to facilitate discussion (and, eventually, merge).

      </section>
      
      <section id="draft">
        <h2>Core HTML Draft Publication</h2>
        <p>
          While the CGs may publish as they please, the core HTML WG at present retains the
          responsibility of publishing the HTML specification itself. The publication is expected to
          operate under the following requirements:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Be frequent;</li>
          <li>Minimise additive differences with the WHATWG version (but have extensive leeway to subset it);</li>
          <li>Aspire to be as close to reality, as supported by testing, as possible;</li>
          <li>Avoid the overhead of errata as much as possible, ideally completely;</li>
          <li>Be automated in every manner possible.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Note that “additive” describes features defined as part of the HTML WG.
        </p>
        <p>
          The frequency is expected to be achieved through two-fold automation. First, the draft is
          maintained as a set of transformations to the WHATWG’s version. This avoids synchronisation
          issues that have made work slow and painful in the past. The ideal goal is to reach a
          point at which this specific document is just a subset of WHATWG HTML with two types of
          excisions: parts that do not match reality, and parts that are being developed in separate
          documents. Second, the output from that transformation are to be fed into the new
          automated publishing system and published under <code>/TR/html</code>. As a part of
          HTML, the 2DContext specification can expect the same treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
          It should be noted that while a strict subset is the desirable option, there are cases
          in which it is not entirely possible. Keeping such cases to a minimum is, however, an
          express goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          The astute reader may note at this point that this organisation takes steps towards
          establishing the WHATWG as one CG (which it already is) that publishes through its
          coordination with the HTML WG, with modifications made to account for the atypical nature
          of the document. There are several ways in which such a setup would be desirable, and the
          organisation is deliberate. However it should be noted that it is not at this point a
          political reality, that making it so would require a number of issues between the two
          groups to be addressed, and that no claim is made here about endorsement from the WHATWG
          for this policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The DOM specification is expected to follow a similar treatment, modulo the fact that
          strict subsetting (corresponding exclusively to test-failing) is far more likely. Having
          said that, some interoperability issues with the DOM that cannot be subsetted away are
          currently pending implementer input, and without such input the specification may,
          according to the principles expressed herein, find itself on indefinite hold.
        </p>
        <p>
          The expectation is that the HTML specification will go to Recommendation every year,
          based on the features it contains that have tests and pass them sufficiently well. Rules
          concerning which tests ought to pass or not tend to have nasty side-effect (e.g. removing
          tests to ensure that the document passes and other such weaselling). Instead, the
          recommended practice is to make use of judgement calls when assessing interoperability,
          the key components of which being rough usability by developers and improvements compared
          to the previous year’s situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even with the improvements to the errata process, one has to question whether it is useful
          to maintain errata against HTML. Errata are valuable in the case in which no new features
          are being added to a specification, and patent commitments that were made for an existing
          Recommendation may no longer be made for the revised one.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML is not in such a situation. HTML is seeing new features, and we are not seeing major
          shifts in participation. The expectation is that publishing a Recommendation every year
          is sufficient to obviate the need for errata. Where required, these could be exposed
          as a diff of the documents as is likely to become possible with Process 2015 (note however
          that such a diff would likely be large and hard to review).

        <h2>Bug Handling</h2>
        <p>
          Over the past few years bugs have been filed in both the WHATWG and the HTML WG. This
          duplication is at best a waste of effort and at worst induces confusion on its own.
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, for “everyday” kind of bugs, the suggestion is to handle them directly in the
          WHATWG. This may not be a consensual proposal, but experience with handling the
          duplication has proven unpleasant (and wasteful). Alternatives suggestions are welcome;
          but the goal is just to be simple and efficient (that there’s enough work for everyone and
          then some).
        </p>
        <p>
          For larger proposals, the default mode of operation is to modularise a chunk where
          possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          The question of escalation remains open. What happens if you filed a bug against WHATWG
          HTML and you don’t like the outcome? In the past the HTML WG has been used as a an avenue
          to help address things gone wrong in the WHATWG (and could generalise that to other CGs),
          on the other such situations can become hostile quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          A large bug backlog has accumulated while the group focused on shipping. These bugs need
          to be ventilated and triaged amongst those that have been overtaken by events, those that
          have been fixed, those that aren’t relevant to the core document and those that,
          shockingly enough, need to be fixed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Triaging the latter will require knowing where they need to be sent. This depends largely
          on the setup described herein coming into effect. It should be noted that some CGs may
          prefer bug tracking systems other than Bugzilla. In such cases the bugs will be moved there
          and the original tracker appraised accordingly.

        <h2>Licensing</h2>
        <p>
          The HTML WG’s CC-BY experiment needs to be updated and revisited. It has surfaced recently
          that the W3C Software License would actually be a great choice for all of our documents.
          It is better than CC0, offers the desired guarantees from CC-BY, but is GPL-compatible. In
          other words it addresses the use cases that lead the WHATWG to use CC0 but is overall
          friendlier in that one does not renounce authorship. It is also the default copyright
          license in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2009/12/Member-Agreement">W3C Member Agreement
          (last 2 sentences of 7b)</a> which states that “copyrightable materials (…) will be made
          available to the general public pursuant to the then-current W3C Software Notice and
          License.”
        </p>
        <p>
          We could characterise the outcome of the CC-BY experiment as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Several drafts were published under CC-BY. Not an overwhelming number in the grand 
              scheme of things, but nevertheless the majority given the general apathy of the
              group.
          <li>It has proven an option attractive enough for other groups to request the same.
          <li>Not one single request to publish under CC-BY was rejected (or in fact questioned).
          <li>However, it does not address the use cases put forth by the proponents of CC0. The 
              primary (possibly only) use case that CC-BY does not address is GPL-compatibility.
        </ul>
        <p>
          Therefore, given:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The consensual nature of CC-BY amongst most of the group; and
          <li>The remaining issue with CC-BY being GPL-compatibility;
        </ul>
        <p>
          we propose an extensive switch to a license that has the attribution and protection
          promises of CC-BY and is GPL-compatible: the W3C Software License. Doing so for the
          main HTML WG is desirable, but would require the agreement of the AC. CGs however can
          freely adopt the license they desire and we suggest that they should use the
          W3C Software License unless overwhelming reasons not to are put forth.

        <h2>Example CGs</h2>
        <p>
          The set of satellite CGs is meant to be dynamic and evolve over time in a flexible manner,
          the sole constraint being the chartered boundaries of the HTML WG. Here are however a few
          examples that could provide good starting grounds based on existing experience.
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Editing
          <dd>
            This is already well under way in the TF but it is hitting up a few Invited Expert
            issues and could live with being a CG rather than the always clunky joint-TF.
          </dd>
          <dt>Media APIs
          <dd>
            New APIs are needed, and some coherence could usefully be brought amongst all the
            people extending HTMLMediaElement. Some recent ideas about media controls could also
            fit here.
          </dd>
          <dt>Markup for Application UIs
          <dd>
            There may be a set of elements that could usefully be added to HTML for
            (semantic) application components. Some work has already kicked off (in a deliberately
            discreet corner) about this and there is interest from some browser vendors. Also: form
            controls are still a problem.

        <h2>Schedule</h2>
        <p>
          While the new group is meant to be flexible and oriented towards action — and therefore
          less amenable to centralised planning — the following schedule is expected to be applied:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Date of republication of HTML 5.1</dt>
          <dd>
            In February. The new Echidna system is expected to support the publication.
          </dd>
          <dt>The mode of operation outlined in this document</dt>
          <dd>
            Assuming the WG can agree to it, it is expected to be deployed during the coming face to
            face meeting in April.
          </dd>
          <dt>Rechartering of the group</dt>
          <dd>
            Much of the rechartering depends on agreement about this plan. Assuming the April
            milestone is hit for that, a new charter can be proposed to the Membership shortly
            thereafter.
          </dd>
          <dt>New CR for the DOM</dt>
          <dd>
            As explained above, our requirements to focus on interoperability are blocking the DOM’s
            furthering along Recommendation-track until at least 
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=22960">bug 22960</a> and
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=19431">bug 19431</a> are
            addressed through implementer decisions. Given the current lack of interoperability any
            alternative blesses an option with insufficient real-world support.
          </dd>
          <dt>2DContext</dt>
          <dd>
            The schedule is currently being re-evaluated.
          </dd>
