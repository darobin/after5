          Shipping HTML 5.0 to Recommendation consumed the lion’s share of the work in the 
          HTML Working Group for the better part of the past two years. With the drive to release
          gone, it is time to reorganise the operation of the group in the manner most conducive
          to improving the Web.
        </p>
        <p>
          Altogether too often W3C working groups have constrained their thinking about how to
          operate to a set of behaviours <em>perceived</em> to represent the requirements placed
          upon them by the W3C Process. Much of the time, these constraints are imaginary. While
          there is no denying that the production of royalty-free technology and a strong preference
          for broad consensus do place some demands on a group’s operation, there are many ways in
          which a group can carry out its day-to-day work without such requirements getting in the
          way. This document endeavours to pave such a way forward for the HTML WG.
        </p>
        <p>
          At a high level, the requirements are (in no particular order):
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Levity</dt>
          <dd>
            The group’s operation must be lightweight. Any manner of administrativia must be eyed
            with suspicion and challenged. Where possible, automation should be applied.
          </dd>
          <dt>Action</dt>
          <dd>
            Doing > talking. Participants are strongly encouraged to do rather than ask, to attend to
            exploration over coordination, to seek forgiveness rather than permission. Plans, such
            as the one you are currently reading, need to be kept to a strict minimum and oriented
            towards liberating rather than guiding.
          </dd>
          <dt>Peace</dt>
          <dd>
            It is a heavy understatement to say that the relationship between the HTML WG and other
            groups has at times being invidious. Whatever history may exist with various parties,
            this document invites the HTML WG to, in the words of a modern philosopher, “shake it
            off”. The primary focus of the group is in providing a support base for the production
            of useful standards. As such, and within the bounds of its mission, it shall strive to
            be a good citizen and encourages resolving issues with minimal escalation — ideally
            without involving the full group.
          </dd>
          <dt>Thoughtfulness</dt>
          <dd>
            Altogether too often has uncivil behaviour been tolerated in the standards community.
            This should no longer be tolerated in any shape manner or form.
          </dd>
          <dt>Independence</dt>
          <dd>
            The Web platform is large, and the HTML specification a large chunk of it. Operating on
            such large chunks as atomic units and broaching topics with a correspondingly large
            group has negative side-effects. It is a core requirement to, as much as possible and
            keeping in mind the risks associated with platform interactions, make it as easy as
            possible for smaller, focused groups to work on documents and in groups with manageable
            scale. Specifications that are too large remove responsibility from their editors by
            creating “too big to fail” effects; a direct goal here is to make editors more
            responsible for their production.
          </dd>
          <dt>Participation</dt>
          <dd>
            The level of participation in the HTML WG — and in standards production in general — is
            too low. Both the structure and modality of work need to be oriented towards increasing
            and facilitating participation. Contributing to the Open Web Platform should be no
            harder than contributing to any open source project.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          Note that while this document specifically targets the HTML WG, it can also read as a
          broad set of suggestions for reform in the manner in which groups in general operate, most
          specifically large groups with broad remits.
        </p>
      </div>

      <section id="org">
        <h2>Organisation &amp; Work Mode</h2>
        <p>
          Looking at the parts of the HTML WG that have and have not been productive over the past
          few years it seems clear that the main group has a poor track record to show for itself,
          while useful work has taken place in more focused groups sitting at its periphery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Certainly the adamantine focus on shipping that dominated the main group is part of this,
          but not alone. There are several issues with working as part of a broad group:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Would-be participants report it as daunting;</li>
          <li>The platform is broad while interests are often more specific;</li>
          <li>It encourages drive-by comments;</li>
          <li>It discourages participation from those who do not wish to handle a fire-hose;</li>
          <li>
            What dysfunctional behaviour may exist in the group tends to be suffered by all while
            the parts that operate well mostly benefit (directly) those who care about them;
          </li>
          <li>
            Coupled with a large document that carries a deep gravitational well it discourages
            contributions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A single group is not without its advantages (notably built-in coordination) but in
          practice they are outweighed by the issues. It is notable that groups that operate as one
          large entity have resorted to filtering mechanisms, and in effect many participants are
          known to tune out the parts they do not directly care about.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, we recommend the following organisation for the group: focused topic areas,
          some of which are currently handled as separate Task Forces, are to be handled in their
          own Community Groups. The list of CGs need not be fixed, on the contrary it is expected
          to evolve over time (within the boundaries of the HTML WG’s charter).
          <a href="#cgs">Examples of possible CGs</a> are given below.
        </p>
        <p>
          CGs can organise as they wish to. They can involve broad participation. Their process can
          be radically lightweight, while still operating within the boundaries of an IPR policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Note</strong>: by the time the charter for this new group is approved, the 
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/01-invited-expert.html">2015/01 version
          of the Invited Expert and Collaborator Agreement</a> is expected to be in effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          CGs can notably publish forkable specification (see notes below on 
          <a href="#licensing">licensing</a>). They need not rely on communication methods that are
          often disliked by today’s Web developers and can easily make use of more modern
          alternatives (more on this in the <a href="#tooling">tooling section</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Under this regime the HTML WG would serve as a coordination forum between CGs, helping to
          sort out problems that may need cooperation amongst them or with the core HTML
          specification (<a href="#draft">publication details for which</a> are outlined below). It
          can also serve as a catch-all group for work that does not yet have a home of its own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technical disputes are encouraged to be addressed through forking and merging, the goal
          being for dissent to operate on camera-ready documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          CGs that produce Final Specifications can bring them to the HTML WG as a way to get them
          to Recommendation relatively efficiently. As experience is gathered with this division of
          labour, the HTML WG could set up procedures allowing for the automatic publication of
          CG Final Specifications as Candidate Recommendations (which can be a FPWD at the same
          time).
        </p>
        <p>
          Community Groups have a broad mandate to organise themselves in whatever creative manner
          they see fit, provided that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>They document where one can follow and participate the work;</li>
          <li>
            They, in practice, adhere to a form of consensus decision-making. Note that this can
            vary very much from one instantiation to another.
          </li>
          <li>
            They keep as good a paper trail as possible of contributions from participants. A good
            example of such a paper trail would be commit logs or pull-requests.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The expectation is that the core group would operate under the 2014 Process (without which
          the useful mouthful that is the “First Public Working Draft Candidate Recommendation” is
          not possible).
        </p>
        <p>
          The work mode for the core HTML group will continue to be derived directly from that of
          WebApps. Usage of regular telcons should be revisited by the group, while of course ad hoc
          ones can be scheduled (and CGs are allowed to make use of them is they so desire). If
          desired, a coordination call between CGs may be held, for instance on a monthly basis.
          Occasional face to face meetings are to be expected, but may not involve the entire group
          (except at least once a year).

      <section id="tooling">
        <h2>Open Tooling</h2>
        <p>
          Both the main group and its satellite CGs can make use of whatever tools they see fit for
          a given specification, but we call out a number of options here as they are expected to
          take up a central place in these operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          For drafts under the control of an actual WG (since this is not an option we can offer CGs
          yet) the new “<a href="https://github.com/w3c/echidna">Echidna</a>” automated publishing
          system that is to be deployed on <code>labs.w3.org</code> in early February is strongly
          encouraged. This tool essentially allows a group to use <a
          href="http://w3.org/TR/">http://w3.org/TR/</a> for its Editor’s Drafts. Editors can set
          their draft up such that any commit triggers a new publication there. This is designed to
          avoid TR space from going stale. As many WDs as are needed can be published, every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Groups that so desire are welcome to make use of GitHub, not just for repositories but
          also for discussion if that is their preference. A tool that makes it possible to backup
          not just the <code>git</code> part but also the issues, comments, etc. is expected to be
          made available when time allows it. This should address concerns over migration should the
          need arise.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="http://discourse.specifiction.org/">Discourse</a> is already available for
          broad discussions with the community. Groups are welcome to request new categories that
          match their needs better than those already in existence (as was done by the
          <a href="http://discourse.specifiction.org/c/asm-js">asm.js</a> folks). The current
          administrators are happy to mint moderators and support the mode of operation required
          by groups wishing to work there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, the <a href="https://specs.webplatform.org/docs/">WebSpecs</a> project is open to
          every and all project that wishes to use it as a publishing platform at which to maintain
          its documents. The project is specifically designed to publish from GitHub repositories
          with very minimal overhead (once you have a specification ready, integrating the project
          is pretty much one pull request away) while avoiding the scattered nature and complexity
          of dozens of GitHub repositories that can be hard to find. It also operates on the core
          assumption that multiple forked version of the same specification can be maintained at the
          same time in order to facilitate discussion (and, eventually, merge).

      </section>
      
      <section id="draft">
        <h2>Core HTML Draft Publication</h2>
        <p>
          While the CGs may publish as they please, the core HTML WG at present retains the
          responsibility of publishing the HTML specification itself. The publication is expected to
          operate under the following requirements:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Be frequent;</li>
          <li>Minimise additive differences with the WHATWG version (but have extensive leeway to subset it);</li>
          <li>Aspire to be as close to reality, as supported by testing, as possible;</li>
          <li>Avoid the overhead of errata as much as possible, ideally completely;</li>
          <li>Be automated in every manner possible.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The frequency is expected to be achieved through two-fold automation. First, the draft is
          maintained as a set of transformations to the WHATWG’s version. This avoids synchronisation
          issues that have made work slow and painful in the past. The ideal goal is to reach a
          point at which this specific document is just a subset of WHATWG HTML with two types of
          excisions: parts that do not match reality, and parts that are being developed in separate
          documents. Second, the output from that transformation are to be fed into the new
          automated publishing system and published under <code>/TR/html</code>. As a part of
          HTML, the 2DContext specification can expect the same treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
          It should be noted that while a strict subset is the desirable option, there are cases
          in which it is not entirely possible. Keeping such cases to a minimum is, however, an
          express goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          The astute reader may note at this point that this organisation takes steps towards
          establishing the WHATWG as one CG (which it already is) that publishes through its
          coordination with the HTML WG, with modifications made to account for the atypical nature
          of the document. There are several ways in which such a setup would be desirable, and the
          organisation is deliberate. However it should be noted that it is not at this point a
          political reality, that making it so would require a number of issues between the two
          groups to be addressed, and that no claim is made here about endorsement from the WHATWG
          for this policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The DOM specification is expected to follow a similar treatment, modulo the fact that
          strict subsetting (corresponding exclusively to test-failing) is far more likely. Having
          said that, some interoperability issues with the DOM that cannot be subsetted away are
          currently pending implementer input, and without such input the specification may,
          according to the principles expressed herein, find itself on indefinite hold.
        </p>
        <p>
          The expectation is that the HTML specification will go to Recommendation every year,
          based on the features it contains that have tests and pass them sufficiently well. Rules
          concerning which tests ought to pass or not tend to have nasty side-effect (e.g. removing
          tests to ensure that the document passes and other such weaselling). Instead, the
          recommended practice is to make use of judgement calls when assessing interoperability,
          the key components of which being rough usability by developers and improvements compared
          to the previous year’s situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even with the improvements to the errata process, one has to question whether it is useful
          to maintain errata against HTML. Errata are valuable in the case in which no new features
          are being added to a specification, and patent commitments that were made for an existing
          Recommendation may no longer be made for the revised one.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML is not in such a situation. HTML is seeing new features, and we are not seeing major
          shifts in participation. The expectation is that publishing a Recommendation every year
          is sufficient to obviate the need for errata. Where required, these could be exposed
          as a diff of the documents as is likely to become possible with Process 2015 (note however
          that such a diff would likely be large and hard to review).
        </p>

      <section id="issues">
        <h2>Bug Triage</h2>
        <p>
          A large bug backlog has accumulated while the group focused on shipping. These bugs need
          to be ventilated and triaged amongst those that have been overtaken by events, those that
          have been fixed, those that aren’t relevant to the core document and those that,
          shockingly enough, need to be fixed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Triaging the latter will require knowing where they need to be sent. This depends largely
          on the setup described herein coming into effect. It should be noted that some CGs may
          prefer bug tracking systems other than Bugzilla. In such cases the bugs will be moved there
          and the original tracker appraised accordingly.

      <section id="licensing">
        <h2>Licensing</h2>
        <p>
          The HTML WG’s CC-BY experiment needs to be updated and revisited. It has surfaced recently
          that the W3C Software License would actually be a great choice for all of our documents.
          It is better than CC0, offers the desired guarantees from CC-BY, but is GPL-compatible. In
          other words it addresses the use cases that lead the WHATWG to use CC0 but is overall
          friendlier in that one does not renounce authorship. It is also the default copyright
          license in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2009/12/Member-Agreement">W3C Member Agreement
          (last 2 sentences of 7b)</a> which states that “copyrightable materials (…) will be made
          available to the general public pursuant to the then-current W3C Software Notice and
          License.”
        </p>
        <p>
          We could characterise the outcome of the CC-BY experiment as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Several drafts were published under CC-BY. Not an overwhelming number in the grand 
              scheme of things, but nevertheless the majority given the general apathy of the
              group.
          <li>It has proven an option attractive enough for other groups to request the same.
          <li>Not one single request to publish under CC-BY was rejected (or in fact questioned).
          <li>However, it does not address the use cases put forth by the proponents of CC0. The 
              primary (possibly only) use case that CC-BY does not address is GPL-compatibility.
        </ul>
        <p>
          Therefore, given:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The consensual nature of CC-BY amongst most of the group; and
          <li>The remaining issue with CC-BY being GPL-compatibility;
        </ul>
        <p>
          we propose an extensive switch to a license that has the attribution and protection
          promises of CC-BY and is GPL-compatible: the W3C Software License. Doing so for the
          main HTML WG is desirable, but would require the agreement of the AC. CGs however can
          freely adopt the license they desire and we suggest that they should use the
          W3C Software License unless overwhelming reasons not to are put forth.

          The set of satellite CGs is meant to be dynamic and evolve over time in a flexible manner,

            New APIs are needed, and some coherence could usefully be brought amongst all the

            There may be a set of elements that could usefully be added to HTML for
            (semantic) application components. Some work has already kicked off (in a deliberately
            discreet corner) about this and there is interest from some browser vendors. Also: form
            controls are still a problem.

          While the new group is meant to be flexible and oriented towards action — and therefore
          less amenable to centralised planning — the following schedule is expected to be applied:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Date of republication of HTML 5.1</dt>
          <dd>
            In February. The new Echidna system is expected to support the publication.
          </dd>
          <dt>The mode of operation outlined in this document</dt>
          <dd>
            Assuming the WG can agree to it, it is expected to be deployed during the coming face to
            face meeting in April.
          </dd>
          <dt>Rechartering of the group</dt>
          <dd>
            Much of the rechartering depends on agreement about this plan. Assuming the April
            milestone is hit for that, a new charter can be proposed to the Membership shortly
            thereafter.
          </dd>
          <dt>New CR for the DOM</dt>
          <dd>
            As explained above, our requirements to focus on interoperability are blocking the DOM's
            furthering along Recommendation-track until at least 
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=22960">bug 22960</a> and
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=19431">bug 19431</a> are
            addressed through implementer decisions. Given the current lack of interoperability any
            alternative blesses an option with insufficient real-world support.
          </dd>
          <dt>2DContext</dt>
          <dd>
            The schedule is currently being re-evaluated.
          </dd>
