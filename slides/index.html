          <h2>The Gory Details</h2>
          <p>
            This presentation focuses on <strong>participation</strong> and the <strong>WHATWG</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enquiring minds should feel free to consult the <a href="http://darobin.github.io/after5/html-plan.html">full plan</a>.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>WHATWG Relationship</h2>
          <p>
            Cross-organisation discussions about process are tedious, invidious, and have an observed
            low rate of success.
          </p>
          <p>
            The core of the policy is therefore rooted in action and being a good citizen while
            minding one’s own business as a group.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the participation policy based on CGs succeeds, maybe a situation could arise in
            which the WHATWG would become one such CG. But that is at best long-term.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>WHATWG: HTML</h2>
          <p>
            Interference with the WHATWG is kept to a minimum by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Automatic publishing (no cherry-picking)</li>
            <li>Deforking where possible</li>
            <li>Aiming to publish a strict subset</li>
            <li>Moving additive work to other documents</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We could reach a point at which the core HTML specification is emptied and only 
            contained in modules. But this is at best far away.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>WHATWG: DOM</h2>
          <p>
            The DOM specification is already under the automatic publishing and strict subset policy
            that is suggested for HTML. As far as it reaches, it is a qualified success.
          </p>
          <p>
            As detailed in the full plan however, taking it further to Recommendation is blocking
            on some bugs. These are orthogonal to the WHATWG relationship however.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>WHATWG: Other documents</h2>
          <p>
            The HTML WG does not expect to fork other documents. URL is getting its own group.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Participation: Problems</h2>
          <p>
            The HTML WG is seeing abysmal participation.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The core parts of HTML are not a priority for many</li>
            <li>The large group and document are daunting</li>
            <li>The bad history still scares people away</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Part°: (Qualified) Success</h2>
          <p>
            We have seen some qualified successes with participation broken up into smaller, more
            focused groups.
          </p>
          <p>
            Questions as to whether that constitutes sufficient data to build a decision upon, operating
            with smaller focused groups makes intuitive sense.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Participation: Structure</h2>
          <p>
            Work is distributed to smaller groups, likely Community Groups (but exact modalities are
            up for discussion). The HTML WG is used as a coordination platform amongst them.
          </p>
          <p>
            CGs can choose their work mode, tooling, and licenses. However some specifics are
            encouraged (WebApps work mode, WebSpecs tooling, W3C Software License). Experimentation
            is welcome as it can inform us all quickly, with minimal discursive overhead.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Participation: Tooling (1)</h2>
          <p>
            CGs are encouraged to use GitHub. A tool for full-fledged backups will be needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The core group will be using <a href="https://github.com/w3c/echidna">Echidna</a>.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Participation: Tooling (2)</h2>
          <p>
            All groups are welcome to use Discourse for general-purpose input from the community,
            or for full-fledged discussions (as used by asm.js).
          </p>
          <p>
            CGs (which can’t use Echidna) are encouraged to use the WebSpecs project which provides
            automated publishing tooling at https://specs.webplatform.org/.
