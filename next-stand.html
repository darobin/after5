          The idea that Web standards should be open and efforts to make them so have served us
          well. Over time, however, the ways in which people build the Web have evolved. The ways in
          which we cooperate have improved. Much that was experimental in open source projects a
          decade or two ago, and even more that we never foresaw back then, now forms the bedrock of
          Web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          The manner in which we create Web standards today lags behind the Web community’s
          common practices. In 2012, a small group of standards organisations came together to
          affirm the principles of openness known as the “<a
          href='http://open-stand.org/principles/'>Open Stand</a>”. Fine principles, but
          no longer sufficient. In order to deliver on the Web’s promise, we need to operate so as
          to grant the full Web community stewardship over the platform. The Web has disrupted many
          aspects of technology. It is time to have it disrupt the way in which we produce Web
          standards. That is the <em>Next Stand</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Web technology is a commons. We need to manage it as such.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is much to do but examples such as the
          <a href='http://responsiveimages.org/'>RICG</a> or the
          <a href='http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/'>DOM</a> show that it is within reach and
          tell us of the pitfalls to avoid. This document is not intended to be final; rather, in
          keeping with the principles it upholds, it is
          <a href='https://github.com/darobin/the-next-stand'>open for all to edit</a>.

      indicate that the documentation and specs will be centralised on specs.webplatform.org

      change of template (presented as an experiment)
      guides for developers extracted from the likes of the QA framework and the Marcos/Dom document

      What is an Open Standard
        - pick up the ideas in the TAG email
      
      
      Specifications should be more like software
        - in how they are managed
          - testing (see more below)
        - in how they can be used
          - live examples
        - we are still handling specifications as if they were paper
        - branches
      
      Splitting HTML
      
      Testing
        - a specification ought to include tests of its own features. These can then be more easily
          woven into the text (by reference) and managed as the specification evolves.
        - linting can be done
        
      How To Make Them RF?
      
      Financial Support
        - reasons to need an underlying organisation
          - most large OSS projects are backed by some form of organisation
          - cat herding
          - assign resources to get things done that aren't being picked up
          - handling of the IP matter in relation to the W3C
        - means
          - crowdfunding/reports
          - consulting
          - teaching
          - test development
